# Another modular HBRS LaTeX template
The official template has a bunch of deprecated functions. Other templates weren't modular. So I decided to make my own one. 

2023: I'm not maintaining the templated. But I will approve pull requests!

## How to use
1. Install LaTeX with all its dependencies
2. Compile `Vorlage.tex` using LaTeX

## Personal recommendations for GNU/Linux users 
* `aspell` for spell checking: http://aspell.net/
* If you're into GNOME I'd recommend `GNOME LaTeX` (recently called `LaTeXila`) which has the native ability to use `aspell` dictionaries, command completion and templates for structures you can insert: https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/GNOME-LaTeX

**PS:** In English for our international students.
