# Another modular HBRS LaTeX template
Since the official template has a bunch of deprecated functions and the rest I got so far aren't modular and even nowhere published, I decided to make this one. 

I'm glad about or any issues and pull requests!!!

## How to use
1. Install LaTeX with all its dependencies
2. Compile `Vorlage.tex` using LaTeX

## Personal recommendations for GNU/Linux users 
* `aspell` for spell checking: http://aspell.net/
* If you're into GNOME I'd recommend `GNOME LaTeX` (recently called `LaTeXila`) which has the native ability to use `aspell` dictionaries, command completion and templates for structures you can insert: https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/GNOME-LaTeX

**PS:** In English for our international students.
